# Arctic

## Overview
Arctic is a decentralized password manager that leverages the power of Seal and Walrus to securely store and share the password on blockchain.
The reasons behind the name `Arctic` are:
- Arctic is where both the seal and the walrus inhabit
- Arctic is also a secret and secured place to store your most valuable assets
With that in mind, Arctic aims to achieve the same level of security for credentials storage.
